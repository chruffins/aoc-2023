# Advent of Code 2023
Welcome to my Advent of Code 2023 repository! As you may have already noticed, the first few solutions are all written in C. As of finishing Day 4, I am already considering giving up writing the rest of my solutions in C, and switching to a language that at least has support for printing out arrays (even if it's relatively trivial to do in C).
